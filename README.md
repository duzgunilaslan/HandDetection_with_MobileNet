# HandDetection_with_MobileNet

The main purpose of the model is to make it easier and more convenient for students to have a say or vote during online education and online meetings or during the course. Tensorflow framework and Transfer Learning approaches were used for model training. MobileNet was used as a Pre-Trainnig model. With Tensorflow-fine tunning, the last layer of mobilenet has been trained and the accuracy rate has been increased up to 99.18%.

You can use the model directly.
If you use the json file for javascript project, you can find in the tensorflowjs file.
